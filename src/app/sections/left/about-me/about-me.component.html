<app-section heading="About Me">
  <p>Hey there!</p>

  <p>I'm <img src="/assets/logos/amruth-pillai.png" alt="Amruth Pillai" />, and as you might have already
    read in quite a number of places, I'm a designer, developer,
    photographer and a writer, and this website was made to showcase all of what I can do. Don't judge my writing
    based
    on this about me though, this is by far my shoddiest work yet.</p>

  <p>I got into design because I believe I have a mild case of <abbr title="Obsessive Compulsive Disorder">OCD</abbr>,
    as
    in, I hate to see things 'not look good'. So I set
    out on a journey to make products that people use that 'look great', and I'm forever on that path.</p>

  <p>I got into development because computers have always fascinated me. <code>int i = 10;</code> creates an integer
    of
    value 10?
    <span style=" text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-style: dotted;" tooltip="In case you didn't catch that, that was sarcasm...">LIKE,
      WOW!</span> But seriously, just seeing code
    getting converted to things we use on a regular basis, like Facebook or
    Amazon, was no less than magic to me and that's where my quest to invent began.</p>

  <p>I got into photography for a very philosophical reason and a very weird one at that. To me, photography is no
    less
    than time-travel. When I look at a photo, I am instantly transported to that moment in time when I shot it, that
    memory takes over. It's a beautiful art form to express creativity as well, and it's been a passion of mine since
    my
    childhood.</p>

  <p>I created this website so I could showcase all this and through this process, make it easier for you to connect
    with
    me. If you like what you saw, head over to the <a href="#contact">contact section</a> below and send me a text. I
    would love to hear from
    you!</p>
